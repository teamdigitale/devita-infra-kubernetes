resources:
   # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
   # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
   # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
   # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.

   #   cpu: 100m
